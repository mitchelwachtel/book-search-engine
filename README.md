### Description
This app has the feature to be able to search using Google's Book Search API. Users are able to create a Login, or sign in to their already made account. Upon looking at their search results, users are able to add books to their saved directory. A book's information is saved to the MongoDB associated with this user. Users can view their saved books and delete items from their list.

This app originally had routes set up with RESTful APIs, but I have refactored this code to work through graphql.
